We consider the dimensionality of social networks, and develop experiments aimed at predicting that dimension. We find that a social network model with nodes and links sampled from an m-dimensional metric space with power-law distributed influence regions best fits samples from real-world networks when m scales logarithmically with the number of nodes of the network. This supports a logarithmic dimension hypothesis, and we provide evidence with two different social networks, Facebook and LinkedIn. Further, we employ two different methods for confirming the hypothesis: the first uses the distribution of motif counts, and the second exploits the eigenvalue distribution.

abstract ={A number of recent studies have focused on the statistical properties of networked systems such as social networks and the Worldwide Web. Researchers have concentrated particularly on a few properties that seem to be common to many networks: the small-world property, power-law degree distributions, and network transitivity. In this article, we highlight another property that is found in many networks, the property of community structure, in which network nodes are joined together in tightly knit groups, between which there are only looser connections. We propose a method for detecting such communities, built around the idea of using centrality indices to find community boundaries. We test our method on computer-generated and real-world graphs whose community structure is already known and find that the method detects this known structure with high sensitivity and reliability. We also apply the method to two networks whose community structure is not well known—a collaboration network and a food web—and find that it detects significant and informative community divisions in both cases.},

  Abstract                 = {In this article, we propose new parallel algorithms for the construction and 2:1 balance refinement of large linear octrees on distributed memory machines. Such octrees are used in many problems in computational science and engineering, e.g., object representation, image analysis, unstructured meshing, finite elements, adaptive mesh refinement, and N-body simulations. Fixed-size scalability and isogranular analysis of the algorithms using an MPI-based parallel implementation was performed on a variety of input data and demonstrated good scalability for different processor counts (1 to 1024 processors) on the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center's TCS-1 AlphaServer. The results are consistent for different data distributions. Octrees with over a billion octants were constructed and balanced in less than a minute on 1024 processors. Like other existing algorithms for constructing and balancing octrees, our algorithms have $\mathcal{O}(N\log N)$ work and $\mathcal{O}(N)$ storage complexity. Under reasonable assumptions on the distribution of octants and the work per octant, the parallel time complexity is $\mathcal{O}(\frac{N}{n_p}\log(\frac{N}{n_p})+n_p\log n_p)$, where N is the size of the final linear octree and $n_p$ is the number of processors.},
