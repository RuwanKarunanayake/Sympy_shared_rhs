Objective of this experiment was to identify the speedup achieved by various GPU compatible implementations against the initial CPU version of DENDRO library. For the purpose of testing and experimenting, set of sample data-blocks are generated and used as the input data to the target process. Speedup for each implementations of the each step in the methodology section is measured based on the performance of BSSN solving feature in DENDRO, comparing both CPU and GPU versions against the same set of input data. All the speedup data in this research paper was taken by executing related DENDRO implementations in a computer system with following specifications.
